# DoublyLinkedSortedAddressBook
# Purpose

Reads in contacts from a file of contacts listed line by line and sorts them using a generic doubly linked list.

An AddressBook is comprised of contact objects, and it acts as a way to implement the generic doubly linked list. 

The AddressBook has functionality that includes searching, returning addressbooks of those with the same last name or area code, as well as deleting and inserting while maintaining a sorted list.

The list is indexed on print.
